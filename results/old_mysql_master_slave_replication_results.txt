LINEARIZATION phase

The linearized paths are the following:

<Master,Uninst> <Master,Inst> <Master,Serving> <Master,Auth> <Master,Dump> <Master,MasterServing> 

<Slave,Uninst> <Slave,Inst> <Slave,ReceiveDump> <Slave,Serving> 

<Application,Uninst> <Application,Inst> 


The INSTANCE LINES are the following:

Instance application :
application (C,Uninst) nr.IN-edges =  0
 GO EDGES: 
 RETURN EDGES: 
 INST EDGE: --<Application,Uninst>--> application (Uninst,Inst)

application (Uninst,Inst) nr.IN-edges =  1
 GO EDGES: 
 RETURN EDGES: 
 INST EDGE: --<Application,Inst>--> application (Inst,D)

application (Inst,D) nr.IN-edges =  1
 GO EDGES: 
 RETURN EDGES: 
 INST EDGE: { }

Instance slave :

 RETURN EDGES:

 RETURN EDGES:

master (MasterServing,D) nr.IN-edges =  1
 GO EDGES: 
 RETURN EDGES: 
 INST EDGE: { }

Next we ADD GO (blue) and RETURN (red) EDGES.
